                            VALIDATING YOUR ORDER <br>

                            After you place an order using our shopping cart, we will check the information you give us
                            for validity and compliance
                            with state laws and regulations, by verifying your method of payment or shipping address. We
                            reserve the right to reject
                            any order you place with us, and/or to limit quantities on any order, without giving any
                            reason. If we reject your
                            order, we will attempt to notify you using the e-mail address you have given us with the
                            order. Your credit or debit
                            card will normally not be charged if we reject an order, but we will process a refund if the
                            charge has been made
                            against your card. <br>

                            Your receipt of an electronic or other form of order confirmation does not signify an
                            acceptance of your order, nor does
                            it constitute confirmation of an offer to sell. The licensed retailer fulfilling your order
                            reserves the right at any
                            time after receipt of your order to accept or decline your order for any reason. <br>

                            and orders that use the same
                            billing and/or shipping address. In the event we make a change to an order, we will attempt
                            to notify you by contacting
                            the e-mail and/or billing address provided at the time the order was made. We and/or the
                            licensed retailers that fulfill
                            your orders reserve the right to limit or prohibit sales to dealers.

                            time, that doesn’t mean we

                            jurisdiction to be contrary to law, then such provision shall be construed, as nearly as
                            possible, to reflect the
                            intentions of the parties, with all other provisions remaining in full force and effect.

                            negotiations, discussions or agreements, if any, between the parties with respect to same.
                            These Terms of Service and
